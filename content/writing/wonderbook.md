My co-founder and I just heard back from Google, and the app is now published on both App Store and Google Play.

It is a great feeling when something that was once an idea in Armaan's head became tangible and is now there, right in my pocket.

Funny enough, the first release took us 3 days to build and another 3 weeks to get approvals from the big tech monopoly Google and Apple.

Nonetheless, days like this one remind me why I chose to be an entrepreneur. To suffer for 3 weeks for a moment of pure satisfaction. Please don't ask how we are going to make money, today is not the day.
