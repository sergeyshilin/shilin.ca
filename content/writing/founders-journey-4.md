Back in April, we failed to raise money from Antler, but decided to stick together and keep building. Since then, we've been back and forth on ideas, and I should say, starting from scratch every time is hella exhausting.

A week ago we pushed the [storytelling app for kids](http://shilin.ca/writing/wonderbook/) out there, and it helped refine our values and vision. We want to keep building no matter what, with every new product making us smarter, stronger and closer to our goal. That's the plan. Whether it will work or not, we will find out later.

At the same time, both of us re-opened our profiles on <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching" target="_blank">YC Co-Founder Matching</a>, and we are now looking for the third (business/marketing/sales) teammate with the right idea. It's not optimal to have a three-person team, but better than a two-person team who went crazy because ~~they don't know what they are doing~~ it might be an advantage if the chemistry is right and skills are complementary.

My runaway is between 6 to 10 months. This isn't much, and I am getting more anxious. Every time we come up with an idea, my mind races between "let's start building it because I don't have time" and "let's do more market research because we have to make sure it will be profitable". It's a weird mix, and I am sure my co-founder hates it when I'm like that. He is in a safer situation, his current business covers his living expenses.

I hope we as a society get to live until the day universal basic income becomes a thing, and people stop making stupid career choices, rushed by a dire need to make money, so they could afford food and shelter. Unlit then, gotta hustle, so I could die in peace.
