I refuse giving up my childishness. I simply don’t want to grow up. After all, have you wondered what makes us adults? Is it as simple as reaching the age of 18? And why 18 and not 35, considering people of my generation are likely to live past a 100 years mark.

Talking about “why”, I love applying a rule of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys" target="_blank">“five whys”</a> in day-to-day life. The concept well known in business can spark unthinkably deep conversations. Last winter I hosted a young Turkish friend in my apartment in Ottawa, and after a dinner and drinks our discussion floated into the area of “children vs no children” and the concepts of family.

He started, “I would like to have a family one day”.
Reasonably enough, I asked, “Why?”

“Because people will treat you as an adult”, he rushed.

“Why do you think children are what makes us adults?”

“Because you’ll get to hang out with other parents and families, and your managers will approve of you better, since you’ll fit in their interpretation of the world. They’ll respect you for your responsibilities.”

At this point I got very curious. In my world, I don’t need an approval from parents. Or managers. Or almost anybody, really. Plus, I’ve seen a plenty of astonishingly irresponsible parents. “Why do you need their approval anyway?”, I questioned carefully.

“Because their opinion is important. They decide to promote you or to give you a raise. Friendships with some other parents may open up great opportunities too.”

”But why is it important for you to hang out with parents? I am sure there are opportunities in other circles too…”

At this point we got carried away with a different topic. I didn’t want to question my friend’s belief system. But I could see him being more thoughtful with each new answer.

Be a child. Ask why. Don’t let other people tell you who to become. Be yourself. Be a child.
