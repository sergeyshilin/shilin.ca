It's been 3 weeks since I started experimenting with free-running sleep. This means I go to bed when both my body and brain feel tired enough and I wake up without alarms. The results are confusing. Key observations so far:

<br/>

- I need between 8 to 10 hours of sleep on average. Usually 9.
- The schedule is still unstable but I wake up roughly at the same time, around 9:30.
- Bedtime shifts slightly to later time every day but wake time time is roughly the same, so my circadian rhythm seems to reset every day naturally. This will become clearer with more data.
- Although I still feel like shit when I wake up, I now spend less time in bed between waking up and getting up.

<br/>

Notes

<br/>

- Data source is me writing down the time before I go to bed and the first thing when I wake up. 
- I would often read in bed before falling asleep, so bedtime for half the days should start 20 to 40 minutes later.
- Dec 8 to Dec 11 is me traveling and not logging my sleep
