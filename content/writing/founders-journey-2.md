What I hated the most about a corporate job is times when there's no real work to be done, and you just have to sit in meetings and do nothing. Just be a fly on the wall. That time when you pretend like you spend your 8 hours a day ~~doing something~~ working. 

In fact, nobody really works 8 hours. Read this story about a freelancer who did a stressful week of non-stop work only to find out they worked for 35 hours: https://www.wired.com/story/eight-hour-workday-is-a-lie/

Periods in between projects or features, usually about 2-3 weeks long, is when I complained about my job the most. I couldn't justify wasting my time in such a stupid way, when I could in fact have been working on something useful.

Let's be honest. Most of the work we do at a "real job" (at least as software engineers) is boring. Maybe easy and well-paying, yes, but usually boring. Many big companies sound exciting to work at on paper. Recruiters purposefully make it so. The harsh reality is, it will seem cool in the first 2-3 month, when things are still new and flashy, but this feeling will eventually fade out, and all that's left is realization of having yet another meaningless job. 

This can turn into a long rant. With all that said, yesterday I got an email saying that I was accepted to <a href="https://www.antler.co/location/canada" target="_blank">Antler</a>, a co-founders program in Toronto that starts in February, and I'll need to urgently pack my things and find someone to sublet my apartment in Ottawa to. I can't spend any more time working on things I hate. I only have one life to live. And so I will exercise every opportunity that will help me build the life I want and a job I love.
