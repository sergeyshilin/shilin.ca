Real-life example of what it means when you are a Canadian but suddenly get very annoyed and angry.

Two guys sneaked into the bus without paying. What would a Russian bus driver do? Kick those guys the hell outa the bus. What did my very Canadian bus driver do? Played “Tap your Presto card” message on repeat 20 times. 

This is hilarious. Love it.
