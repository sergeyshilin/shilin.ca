I found a co-founder (English is so funny), and that’s what matters. Tomorrow week six begins. This means we are 7 days away from <a href="http://localhost:1313/writing/founders-journey-2/">Antler</a> telling us “you guys suck” or “you guys keep going”, and the closer we get to this point, the more I feel like an imposter. 

My roommate is Princeton graduate. My co-founder had 2 successful exits and $$$ from investors. I have achievements in Fortnite and hemorrhoid. 

But let’s not forget, imposter syndrome is just that, an imposter. 7 days, folks. We can do it!
