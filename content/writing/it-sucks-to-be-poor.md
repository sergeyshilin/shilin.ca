It sucks having to think about money.

For me it's a choice. For the majority of population it's a reality.

I am glad I am going through this stage now, after I had experienced what it feels when money is not an issue. I am glad because I can clearly see what's wrong with our society. I am glad and yet again,

It sucks.
