I am not a founder, yet. I spent 7 years trying to fit in a traditional career, only to become miserable. I quit my job in October and I’m still not sure how to make money. I’m certain, however, it’s not by selling my 40 hours a week. 

Last 3 months were tough and the next 3 months will be even harder. I’ve launched <a href="https://www.shilin.photo/" target="_blank">my photography website</a> and I’m currently working on my personal online portfolio (this website). I’ve started a project to help people find free parking in Ottawa. I’ve signed up for an <a href="https://www.antler.co/location/canada" target="_blank">accelerator program in Toronto</a> (no feedback from them after a series of interviews but likely got rejected) and I’ve registered on <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching" target="_blank">YC Co-Founder Matching Platform</a> (and had some successful interviews!). I am always doing something, and it always feels like I am not doing enough. 

That being said, I am looking for a co-founder ready to go full-time in the next 3 months. My interests are: 

- fintech
- health & wellness (sleep, diet, meditation etc)
- AI and computer vision

I’m open to explore other industries with the right person. If this sounds like a dating profile to you, I’ll explain in the next posts how finding a co-founder is similar to finding a life partner.

But if you know someone in a similar position, send them my way.

And wish me luck.
