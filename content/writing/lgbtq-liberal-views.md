title: LGBTQ+ and liberal views
description: Talking to my family, like talking to many other Russians, about gay people is hard. The second I said the word “gay”, my mom knew I was gay (spoiler alert, I am not). I thought, well, those are older generation folks with their archaic views. And when I spoke with my brother, who is just slightly older than me, I realized it’s a topic that is better not be discussed with my family.

Talking to my family, like talking to many other Russians, about gay people is hard. The second I said the word “gay”, my mom knew I was gay (I am not). I thought, well, those are older generation folks with their archaic views. And when I spoke with my brother, who is just slightly older than me, I realized it’s a topic that is better not be discussed with my family. 

This week Pride Parade is all over Ottawa. I don’t have to be gay, lesbian, or transgender to come and feel proud. Proud of people that go through oppression and prejudice, every day and in every single place of the world. People that fight stereotypes and win. Proud of Canada to be an open-minded country that has diversity in its core. Proud of myself speaking out loud about it. 

For the majority of my life I had troubles accepting myself (and still do), all while being told that I am not good enough. That I am not as smart as some of my classmates. That I am not as hardworking as some of my coworkers. That I am lazy if I can’t wake up early. That I shouldn’t do that, eat that or wear that. Told by society, friends, and family. I, a white male, young, healthy, straight, and relatively good-looking, have troubles with self-acceptance. Just pause on it for a second.

I can’t imagine what it feels to be gay in Russia today, but I do hope that things will get better. It will come, eventually, as it came to Canada over many years. Let us all have patience and let us all do our best to speed it up.
