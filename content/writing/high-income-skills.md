I’m planning to switch careers. Before I dive into rationalization of this thinking, I'll explain the title.

I won't remember where I first saw this collocation, but the message behind it was clear--- true wealth amplifies exponentially by stacking up skills that correlate with the high potential of earning lots of money. For simplicity, let’s say >$100K a year.

For example, from the skills I have, playing a guitar is low income, bouldering (climbing) — low income, portrait photography — low income, coding — high income, chopping bell pepper in the fastest and the least wasteful way — no income. And a bunch of other skills that will fall into the lower side of the spectrum.

When I look at this list, it screams to me that I have the only high-income skill at the moment, coding. The one that AI will supersede in some 2-3 years. Even though I’m the one to design AI models in the first place…

What’s next is hard to say. Options are rather limited. Marketing, sales, and some people’s skills from management to networking. UX/UI and copyrighting are facing the same fate as coding.

That's why I’m leaning towards sales and/or marketing. It’s harder to automate and it’s essential for running a business, which is another high-income skill on its own. 

But since I’m only looking, suggestions are welcome! What would you recommend and why?
