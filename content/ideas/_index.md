I store my ideas on Notion <a href="https://sshilin.notion.site/Ideas-87e0893af391421da942b37fec62a068" target="_blank">here</a>.

From time to time I work on something interesting. If an idea is in the list, it usually means one of the two things:

1. I am working on it currently
2. I worked this idea through but either the math didn’t add up, or I lost interest, or I simply didn’t have time/resources at that moment.

All ideas are worth nothing until they are implemented, so if you find yourself inspired, you are welcome to borrow it. I promise you, I won’t mind.
