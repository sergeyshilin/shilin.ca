With tremendous effort from our highly skilled team of designers, testers, project managers, and product owners, I was one of the two developers to build this beautiful streaming app from the ground up. It became available on iOS and Android devices and allowed AT&T in-car Wi-Fi users to stream video content on-demand and live.
