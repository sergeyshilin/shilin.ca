WonderBook is a story reader app designed to help parents connect with their children through the magic of storytelling.
With unlimited stories, your child will be transported to far-off lands, enchanted kingdoms, and imaginary worlds.

### Tech

The entirety of the app is React Native with <a href="https://expo.dev/" target="_blank">Epxo.dev</a> for cross-platform deployment and publishing. I used serverless AWS (mostly Lambda) for REST API endpoints to handle requests to OpenAI for generating stories.
