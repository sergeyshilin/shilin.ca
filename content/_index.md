I'm Sergei, a Software Engineer by education, CTO by trade, and an Entrepreneur by heart.

While my interests lie in Machine Learning, over the years I've created a great number of web and mobile applications, APIs and SDKs, prepared and analyzed datasets, set up CI/CD pipelines, deployed hundreds of ML models and docker containers.

Curious about my past project? Check out the [portfolio](/portfolio) and my [GitHub](https://github.com/sergeyshilin) profile. To learn more about my career -- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeyshilin).

Would like to collaborate or just want to say hi? [mail@shilin.ca](mailto:mail@shilin.ca)
