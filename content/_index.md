I'm Sergei, I create products for living. A few things about me:

<br />

- I've built a complex AI system to automatically test games for one of the biggest game dev companies

<br />

- I developed a [beautiful streaming app](/portfolio/wmride/) that led to a company acquisition by WarnerMedia

<br />

- I created a set of Machine Learning algorithms to help a research lab classify over 25 types of ice particles

You can find my other projects [here](/portfolio).
