I'm Sergei, a Software Engineer by trade, an Entrepreneur by heart.

While my interests lie in Machine Learning primarily, I consider myself a solid generalist. Over the years I've created a great number of web and mobile applications, APIs and SDKs, prepared and analyzed datasets, set up CI/CD pipelines, deployed hundreds of ML models and docker containers.  

Curious about my coding skills? Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/sergeyshilin) profile. Would like to learn more about my career -- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeyshilin).
